Consider vowels as a, e, i, o, and u. 
What proportion of company names start with a vowel, and what percent start with anything else?


SELECT SUM(vowels) vowels, SUM(other) other
FROM (SELECT name, CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U') 
                        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS vowels, 
          CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U') 
                       THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS other
         FROM accounts) t1;
