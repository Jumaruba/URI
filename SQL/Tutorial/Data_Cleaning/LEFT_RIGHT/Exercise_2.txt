There is much debate about how much the name (or even the first letter of a company name) matters. 
Use the accounts table to pull the first letter of each company name to see the distribution of company names that begin with each letter (or number). 



SELECT LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) AS first_letter, COUNT(*) num_companies
FROM accounts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
