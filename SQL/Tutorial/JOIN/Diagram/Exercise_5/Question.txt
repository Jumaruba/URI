Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) 
for the order. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. 
A few accounts have 0 for total, so I divided by (total + 0.01) to assure not dividing by zero.
