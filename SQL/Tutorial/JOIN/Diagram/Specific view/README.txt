Primary - Foreign Key Link
In the above image you can see that:

The region_id is the foreign key.
The region_id is linked to id - this is the primary-foreign key link that connects these two tables.
The crow's foot shows that the FK can actually appear in many rows in the sales_reps table.
While the single line is telling us that the PK shows that id appears only once per row in this table.
