If you look a little closer, you might notice that the PK is associated with the first column in every table. 
The PK here stands for primary key.
A primary key exists in every table, and it is a column that has a unique value for every row.


If you look at the first few rows of any of the tables in our database, you will notice that this first, PK, column is always unique. 
For this database it is always called id, but that is not true of all databases.
