SELECT accounts.name, orders.occurred_at
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;


This query only pulls two columns, not all the information in these two tables.
Alternatively, the below query pulls all the columns from both the accounts and orders table.


SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;


And the first query you ran pull all the information from only the orders table:


SELECT orders.*
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;


Exercise:

SELECT orders.standard_qty, orders.gloss_qty, orders.poster_qty, accounts.website, accounts.primary_poc
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON accounts.id = orders.id
