Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. 
However, you should only provide the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 100 and the poster order quantity exceeds 50. 
Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. 
Sort for the largest unit price first. 
In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding .01 to the denominator here is helpful (total_amt_usd/(total+0.01). 

SELECT r.name region, a.name account, (o.total_amt_usd/(o.total+0.01)) unit_price
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
WHERE o.standard_qty>100 AND o.poster_qty>50
ORDER BY unit_price DESC;
