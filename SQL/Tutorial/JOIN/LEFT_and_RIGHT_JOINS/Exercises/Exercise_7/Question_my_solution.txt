What are the different channels used by account id 1001? 
Your final table should have only 2 columns: account name and the different channels. 
You can try SELECT DISTINCT to narrow down the results to only the unique values.

SELECT DISTINCT a.name, w.channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON w.account_id = a.id
WHERE a.id = 1001
