Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. 
However, you should only provide the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 100. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. 
In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding .01 to the denominator here is helpful total_amt_usd/(total+0.01). 



SELECT r.name region, a.name account, (o.total_amt_usd/(o.total+0.01)) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE o.standard_qty>100
