Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. 
This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a first name starting with S and in the Midwest region. 
Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. 
Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name. 

SELECT r.name rep, s.name sales, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE s.name LIKE 'S%' and r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY a.name;

CORRECT!
