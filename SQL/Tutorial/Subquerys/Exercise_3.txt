For the account that purchased the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) standard_qty paper, how many accounts still had more in total purchases? 

First, we want to find the account that had the most standard_qty paper. The query here pulls that account, as well as the total amount:


SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
Now, I want to use this to pull all the accounts with more total sales:

SELECT a.name
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total 
                  FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total
                        FROM accounts a
                        JOIN orders o
                        ON o.account_id = a.id
                        GROUP BY 1
                        ORDER BY 2 DESC
                        LIMIT 1) sub);


This is now a list of all the accounts with more total orders. We can get the count with just another simple subquery.



SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT a.name
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
      ON a.id = o.account_id
      GROUP BY 1
      HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total 
                  FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total
                        FROM accounts a
                        JOIN orders o
                        ON o.account_id = a.id
                        GROUP BY 1
                        ORDER BY 2 DESC
                        LIMIT 1) inner_tab)
            ) counter_tab;
