What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for only the companies that spent more than the average of all orders.

First, we want to pull the average of all accounts in terms of total_amt_usd:


SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id;


Then, we want to only pull the accounts with more than this average amount.


SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd)
FROM orders o
GROUP BY 1
HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
                               FROM orders o
                               JOIN accounts a
                               ON a.id = o.account_id);


Finally, we just want the average of these values.


SELECT AVG(avg_amt)
FROM (SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_amt
    FROM orders o
    GROUP BY 1
    HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
                               FROM orders o
                               JOIN accounts a
                               ON a.id = o.account_id)) temp_table;
