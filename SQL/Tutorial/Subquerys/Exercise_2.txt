For the region with the largest sales total_amt_usd, how many total orders were placed? 

The first query I wrote was to pull the total_amt_usd for each region.
SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name;


Then we just want the region with the max amount from this table. There are two ways I considered getting this amount. One was to pull the max using a subquery. 
Another way is to order descending and just pull the top value.


SELECT MAX(total_amt)
FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY r.name) sub;


Finally, we want to pull the total orders for the region with this amount:


SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (
      SELECT MAX(total_amt)
      FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
              FROM sales_reps s
              JOIN accounts a
              ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
              JOIN orders o
              ON o.account_id = a.id
              JOIN region r
              ON r.id = s.region_id
              GROUP BY r.name) sub);


This provides the Northeast with 2357 orders.
