Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.

First, I wanted to find the total_amt_usd totals associated with each sales rep, and I also wanted the region in which they were located. 
The query below provided this information.


SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;


Next, I pulled the max for each region, and then we can use this to pull those rows in our final result.


SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1;


Essentially, this is a JOIN of these two tables, where the region and amount match.


SELECT t3.rep_name, t3.region_name, t3.total_amt
FROM(SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1) t2
JOIN (SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
     FROM sales_reps s
     JOIN accounts a
     ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
     JOIN orders o
     ON o.account_id = a.id
     JOIN region r
     ON r.id = s.region_id
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) t3
ON t3.region_name = t2.region_name AND t3.total_amt = t2.total_amt;
