What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

First, we just want to find the top 10 accounts in terms of highest total_amt_usd.


SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;


Now, we just want the average of these 10 amounts.


SELECT AVG(tot_spent)
FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
      ON a.id = o.account_id
      GROUP BY a.id, a.name
      ORDER BY 3 DESC
       LIMIT 10) temp;
