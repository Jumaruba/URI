For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) total_amt_usd, how many web_events did they have for each channel?

Here, we first want to pull the customer with the most spent in lifetime value.


SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 1;


Now, we want to look at the number of events on each channel this company had, which we can match with just the id.


SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*)
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id AND a.id =  (SELECT id
                     FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
                           FROM orders o
                           JOIN accounts a
                           ON a.id = o.account_id
                           GROUP BY a.id, a.name
                           ORDER BY 3 DESC
                           LIMIT 1) inner_table)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;


I added an ORDER BY for no real reason, and the account name to assure I was only pulling from one account.
