Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. 
Your final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. 
Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

SELECT r.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;
