For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they purchased across their orders. 
Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average quantity purchased 
for each of the paper types for each account. 

SELECT a.name, AVG(o.standard_qty), AVG(o.poster_qty), AVG(o.gloss_qty)
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name
