Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. 
Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of occurrences. 
Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

SELECT s.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) occurrences
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
GROUP BY w.channel, s.name
ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
