Find the number of sales reps in each region. 
Your final table should have two columns - the region and the number of sales_reps. 
Order from fewest reps to most reps.

SELECT r.name, COUNT(*) num_reps
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY num_reps;

or

SELECT r.name, COUNT (s.id) number
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY number;
