Via what channel did the most recent (latest) web_event occur, which account was associated with this web_event? 
Your query should return only three values - the date, channel, and account name.

SELECT w.channel, w.occurred_at, a.name
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON w.account_id = a.id
ORDER BY w.occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
