Which year did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? 
Are all years evenly represented by the dataset?

SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Again, 2016 by far has the most amount of orders, but again 2013 and 2017 are not evenly represented to the other years 
in the dataset.
