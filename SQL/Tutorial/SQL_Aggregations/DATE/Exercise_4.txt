Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? 
Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?

SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC; 


December still has the most sales, but interestingly, November has the second most sales (but not the most dollar sales. 
To make a fair comparison from one month to another 2017 and 2013 data were removed.
