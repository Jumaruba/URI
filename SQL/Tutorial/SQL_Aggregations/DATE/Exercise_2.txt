Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total dollars? 
Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?


In order for this to be 'fair', we should remove the sales from 2013 and 2017. For the same reasons as discussed above.

SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
