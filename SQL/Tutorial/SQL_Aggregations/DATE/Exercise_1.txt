Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all orders in each year, ordered from greatest to least. Do you notice any trends in the yearly sales totals?


 SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
 FROM orders
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC;

When we look at the yearly totals, you might notice that 2013 and 2017 have much smaller totals than all other years. 
If we look further at the monthly data, we see that for 2013 and 2017 there is only one month of sales for each of these years 
(12 for 2013 and 1 for 2017). Therefore, neither of these are evenly represented. 
Sales have been increasing year over year, with 2016 being the largest sales to date. 
At this rate, we might expect 2017 to have the largest sales.
