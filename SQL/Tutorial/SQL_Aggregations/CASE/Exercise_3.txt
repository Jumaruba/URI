We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders. 
Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, and a column with top or not depending on if they have more than 200 orders. 
Place the top sales people first in your final table.


SELECT s.name, COUNT(*) num_ords,
     CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 THEN 'top'
     ELSE 'not' END AS sales_rep_level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id 
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


It is worth mentioning that this assumes each name is unique - which has been done a few times. We otherwise would want to break by the name and the id of the table.
